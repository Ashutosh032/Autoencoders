# Autoencoders
## MNIST dataset compression and reconstruction using PCA and AutoEncoder.
Trained a PCA model to compress the digits to 4 dimensional latent vectors.
Trained an AutoEncoder model to compress the digits to 4 dimensional latent vectors.
Visualize the latent vectors using TSNE( https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.manifold.TSNE.html) for both the cases.

## Training an autoencoder model for anomaly classification
Used the dataset assigned for your group.
Trained model only on normal set. 
Reconstructed on the test set and showed the reconstruction error.

## Training a VAE model for generating new data similar to training set.
Trained the model on fashionMNIST dataset.
Generated 30 new samples using the learned model and plot them.
